            <div class="question"> Q: Can I still workout if I have a busy schedule?</div>
            <div class="answer"> A: Yes you definitely can! Start by trying to find a free time such as either waking up early, going after work, finding a gap between priorties you have during your day, and most importantly priortize it. What that means is making it a non negotiable in your daily routine, like an appointment or reservation you can't miss. Try the HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) plan, workouts that hit multiple muscle groups at one time, doing supersets, and are high intensity low recovery. *Be aware, HIIT is demanding and you will be fatigued, be sure to listen to your body and not overdo it*.</div>

            <div class="question"> Q: How can I prevent injury during workouts?</div>
            <div class="answer"> A: 1: Warm up properly, start your workouts with dynamic stretches and mobility exercises. 2: Use proper form, maintaining proper form not only prevents injury it also maximizes effectiveness of your workouts. If you are unsure if you are using proper form, look up on youtube or google for the proper form of the exercise you are going to do. 3: Progress gradually, please do not ego lift. Progressive overload is very important but gradually increase the weight and intensity of your exercises. By gradually increasing the intensity, duration, and weight of your workouts it will allow your body to adapt and prevent injuries. 4: Rest and Recovery, both are just as important as exercising. Prioritize quality sleep, hydration, and nutrition to maximize your gains and let your muscles recover. 5: Listen to your body, pay attention to fatigue, pain, and discomfort. Pusing through can sometimes lead to injury, if it doesn't feel right, stop to prevent any furthur injury. Seek medical attention if needed.</div>
